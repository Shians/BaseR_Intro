# Preface

This introduction to base R course was designed for biologists with no previous programming experience. It has a focus on analysing RNA-sequencing data with the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) package [limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html). The F1000 paper ['RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma and edgeR'](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1408/v3) was used as a guide for the latter sessions.

It is intended to be delivered over four 2.5 hour workshops.

The html pages was generated using the amazing [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) package by [YiHui Xie](https://yihui.name/).
